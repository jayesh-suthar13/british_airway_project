**British Airways Virtual Internship – Data Analysis & Predictive Modeling**

This repository contains the end-to-end analysis and machine learning project completed as part of the British Airways virtual internship on Forage. The project focuses on web data extraction, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, preprocessing, and building a predictive machine learning model.  

Key components include:
- Web data extraction from relevant sources  
- Comprehensive EDA using visualizations and statistical summaries  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing for model readiness  
- Predictive modeling using machine learning algorithms  
- A final PowerPoint presentation summarizing the insights and results  

This project showcases practical data science skills applied in a business context, aligned with British Airways’ data-driven decision-making approach.
